# Customers with More Than 20 Orders

## Problem Statement
Write a SQL query to display all loyal customers from the `playground.superstore` table. A customer is considered loyal if they have placed more than 20 orders.

The table includes the following relevant columns:
- `customer_id` (string)
- `customer_name` (string)
- `order_id` (string)

The result should include:
- `customer_id` (varchar)
- `customer_name` (varchar)
- `order_count` (integer)

The output should be sorted by `order_count` in descending order and then by `customer_name` in ascending order.

### Sample Columns
| customer_id | customer_name | order_id |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| CG-12520    | Claire Gute    | CA-2016-152156 |
| DV-13045    | Darrin Van Huff| CA-2016-138688 |
| BH-11710    | Bill Hemmeter | CA-2014-115812 |

## Solution Query
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    customer_name, 
    COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
FROM 
    playground.superstore
GROUP BY 
    customer_id, 
    customer_name
HAVING 
    COUNT(order_id) > 20
ORDER BY 
    order_count DESC, 
    customer_name ASC;
```

### Explanation
To solve this problem:
1. **Grouping**: We group by both `customer_id` and `customer_name` to get per-customer aggregations.
2. **Aggregation**: We count the number of orders per customer using `COUNT(order_id)`.
3. **Filtering**: The `HAVING` clause filters to only include customers with more than 20 orders.
4. **Ordering**: Finally, results are ordered by `order_count` in descending order, and then `customer_name` in ascending order for consistency and readability.
