# Month with the Highest Total Births

## Problem Statement
Determine the month with the highest total number of births in the `playground.us_birth_stats` table. The table includes the following columns:
- `year` (int)
- `month` (int)
- `date_of_month` (int)
- `day_of_week` (int)
- `births` (int)

The result should include:
- `month` (integer)
- `total_births` (integer)

### Sample Data
| year | month | date_of_month | day_of_week | births |
|------|--------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| 2000 | 1      | 1              | 6            | 9083   |
| 2014 | 12     | 31             | 3            | 11990  |
| 2014 | 12     | 30             | 2            | 13634  |
| 2014 | 12     | 29             | 1            | 12811  |
| 2014 | 12     | 28             | 7            | 7724   |
| 2014 | 12     | 27             | 6            | 8656   |
| 2014 | 12     | 26             | 5            | 10386  |
| 2014 | 12     | 25             | 4            | 6749   |
| 2014 | 12     | 24             | 3            | 9308   |
| 2014 | 12     | 23             | 2            | 12604  |

## Solution Query
```sql
SELECT month, SUM(births) AS total_births
FROM playground.us_birth_stats
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY total_births DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation
To find the month with the most births:
- **Aggregation**: Use `SUM(births)` to calculate the total number of births per month.
- **Grouping**: Use `GROUP BY month` to aggregate births by each month across all years.
- **Sorting**: Order the results in descending order by `total_births` so the month with the highest total comes first.
- **Limiting**: Use `LIMIT 1` to return only the top result.

This approach effectively identifies the month with the greatest birth volume in the dataset.
